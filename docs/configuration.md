# Config File

If there is no config.json file in the instance folder, the program will create one with the default values in archivepodcast/config.py.

The default config will not be enough to start the program as you need to define the podcasts you want to archive.

Here is an example with a podcast defined:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "web_page": {
      "title": "Podcast Archive",
      "description": "Podcast archive, generated by archivepodcast, available at https://github.com/kism/archivepodcast",
      "contact": "archivepodcast@localhost"
    },
    "inet_path": "http://localhost:5100/",
    "storage_backend": "local",
    "s3": {
      "cdn_domain": "https://example.com/public_url_of_s3_bucket/",
      "api_url": null,
      "bucket": "",
      "access_key_id": "",
      "secret_access_key": ""
    }
  },
  "podcasts": [
    {
      "url": "https://feeds.simplecast.com/CpvnpIaj",
      "new_name": "STown",
      "name_one_word": "stown",
      "description": "",
      "live": true,
      "contact_email": ""
    }
  ],
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "path": null,
    "simple": false
  },
  "flask": {
    "TESTING": false
  }
}
```
