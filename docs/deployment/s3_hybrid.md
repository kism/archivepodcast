# Deployment: Hybrid S3

This configuration uses S3 for asset storage while maintaining a standard web application deployment.

## Configuration Requirements

* In config.toml set storage_backend to 's3'
* Fill in the s3 config with what's appropriate for your bucket, make sure your api credential has read + write on the bucket
* Ensure you s3 bucket has a domain. In config.toml set the cdn_domain to that domain
